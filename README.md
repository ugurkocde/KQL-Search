# What is KQL?

KQL, or Kusto Query Language, is a query language used to search and analyze data in Microsoft Azure's data platform. It is used to perform ad hoc queries on data stored in Azure data services, including Azure Log Analytics, Azure Data Explorer, and Azure Monitor logs.

KQL has a syntax similar to SQL, but is designed specifically for querying and analyzing log data. It allows users to filter and aggregate data, extract specific fields, and perform a wide range of statistical and analytical operations on data sets. KQL also has a number of built-in functions and operators that can be used to manipulate and analyze data.
